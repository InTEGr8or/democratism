# A Comprehensive Criticism of Democracy's Core Principles

Currently, the Democratic Party is in crisis, so it is a very good time to look closely at all the ways it is falling apart and ask ourselves: "Is this a failure of the Democratic Party, or are there problems with the concept of democracy as a political ideal?"

But why use the word "democratism" instead of "democracy"? Well, we have words such as liberalism and conservatism, which are used to describe political campaigns and ideologies. So, why not use the word "democratism" to describe the political campaign and ideology of democracy as a political campaign to promote the ideology of democracy? Anyone who doubts that this ideology is promoted needs only to look at the popular daily use of the word "democratization" in all its various meanings.

There should be no doubt that there is a political campaign to promote the ideology of democracy. There is even a recent compilation of hundreds of news promoters in hundreds of different markets in the US reciting the exact same multi-paragraph script which concludes with "this is extremely troublling to our democracy". No reference is given to who wrote the script they are all reciting, but surely the multi-paragraph reciting was not repeated by hundreds of outlets accidently. Every standard of detecting plagerism would indicate that the public statement was _cooordinated_.

So, we are using "democratism" to describe the political campaign and ideology of democracy as a political campaign to promote the ideology of democracy. We will also loop in the concept of "democratization" as it is used in political _and economic_ discourse and as an ideal.

To perform this comprehensive analysis, we must first clarify what the concept of democracy is. We'll look at how democracy is used in political discourse and how it's defined in political theory. Then, we'll examine the core principles of democracy and critically evaluate them.

Why? Certainly, this is a worthy endeavor since so much of society and culture are handed over to democratic arbitration. The concept of "democratization" is widely used on a regular basis as an ideal to be used in determining who get's what, and why. So, "democratization" will also fall under our microscope and telescope of critical analysis. We will attempt to look at it from every angle, including from the inside and the outside.

If democracy is prommoted as an idea, that is to say, as something to be pursued in life and even as a political campaign, and if it is false or flawed, then it will promote false requirements. False requirements _always_ end up sovling the wrong problem. So we will also investigate all the cultural artifacts that have been produced and that we live with today because moralists and "thought leaders" have been promoting the false requirements of democracy for many decades.

So let us begin with a comprehensive list of both the popular concept of democracy and the more technically developed definitions of democracy so that we can "deconstruct" them.

NOTE: I will be using the justifications for democracy produced by OPEN AI's GPT-4o model as a first draft. It has read much of the internet, and the LLM is specifically designed to produce the most common text phrases, so it is probably a better starting point than any academic study, however, we will also incorporate those as time permits.
