Do you think you own anything?

Democratism opposes that.

As a political ideal, democratism stands in direct opposition to private ownership.

Democratists make the vague claim that "the people" should own everything, but they don't specify what that means. They don't specify what "the people" are, or how they are to be organized. They don't specify what "ownership" means, or how it is to be exercised. They don't specify what "everything" is, or how it is to be divided. They don't specify what "should" means, or how it is to be enforced.

Democratists make this claim as if it were a self-evident truth, as if it were a matter of common sense, as if it were a matter of fact.

It is by far the dominant political ideal in the U.S., which is probably still the most influential example of liberated political discourse and argument.

## The Smoking Gun of the Crime

The strongest evidence of the swindle of democratism is the claim that the printing press, or the personal computer, or the internet, or bitcoin are examples of "the democratization of" information or banking. This is the smoking gun of the crime.

It is truely shocking how many people unwitingly repeat the lie that the printing press was an example of democratization, or that the internet "democratizes" information.

It is a tragedy, a crime, and the cause of widespread cofusion.

## The Printing Press was Privatization

Printing presses were privately owned. The owner decided what he would publish, not a public vote.

The private publication of 16th century pamphlets was not democratization. It was privatization.

## The Internet is Privatization

The internet is privately owned. The owner decides what he will publish, not a public vote.
