### Detailed Plan: Fix Sub-Node Content Display on Folder Index Pages

1.  **Understand the Current Issue:**
    *   The `src/pages/[...slug].astro` component is responsible for rendering individual content pages and folder index pages (`_index.md`).
    *   When an `_index.md` file is accessed, it should display its own content followed by panels for its immediate children (files and subfolders within that specific directory).
    *   Currently, the logic for identifying and displaying these child content panels is flawed, causing them not to appear.

2.  **Analyze `src/pages/[...slug].astro` (Lines 36-42):**
    *   The `isFolderIndex` check (line 30) correctly identifies `_index.md` files.
    *   The `childContent` filtering logic is where the problem lies.
        *   `childEntry.id.startsWith(currentFolderSlugForChildren + '/')`: `currentFolderSlugForChildren` is derived from `entry.data.slug` (e.g., `whats-wrong-with-democratism`), which does *not* include the `docs/` collection prefix. However, `childEntry.id` *does* include this prefix (e.g., `docs/whats-wrong-with-democratism/democratism-vs-property`). This mismatch causes the `startsWith` check to fail.
        *   `childEntry.id.split('/').length === currentFolderSlugForChildren.split('/').length + 1`: This length check is also incorrect because `currentFolderSlugForChildren`'s split length is based on the slug, not the full `entry.id` path, leading to an inaccurate comparison for direct children.

3.  **Propose Refined Filtering Logic:**
    *   To accurately identify direct children, we need a more robust approach that considers the full path of the parent `_index.md` file.
    *   We will define a `parentPath` variable by taking the `entry.id` of the current `_index.md` file and removing the `/_index` suffix (e.g., `docs/whats-wrong-with-democratism`). This `parentPath` will serve as the base for identifying direct children.
    *   The filtering logic for `childContent` will then be updated to include entries that meet the following criteria:
        *   The `childEntry.id` is not identical to the current `entry.id` (to exclude the parent `_index.md` itself).
        *   The `childEntry.id` must start with `parentPath + '/'`.
        *   The `relativePath` (the portion of `childEntry.id` that comes *after* `parentPath + '/'`) must satisfy one of these conditions:
            *   It does *not* contain any further slashes (indicating a direct child *file*, e.g., `democratism-vs-property`).
            *   It contains exactly one slash and ends with `_index` (indicating a direct child *folder's _index.md* file, e.g., `subfolder/_index`).

4.  **Implement Changes in `src/pages/[...slug].astro`:**
    *   Modify the `childContent` filtering section (lines 36-42) to incorporate the refined logic described above.

5.  **Validate the Fix:**
    *   Start the Astro development server using `npm run dev`.
    *   Navigate to `http://localhost:4321/whats-wrong-with-democratism`.
    *   Verify that the child content panels (e.g., "Democratism vs. Property", "Equity is Evil", "The Democratist Political Pyramid Scheme") are now correctly displayed below the main content of the `_index.md` page.
    *   (Optional) If available or created, use `scripts/check-subfolder-content.ts` to programmatically verify the content.
