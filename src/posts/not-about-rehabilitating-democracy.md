This Deep Dive should not focus on rehabilitiating democratism.

Pointing out the association between fascism and democratism _is not_, and should not be viewed as an attempt to rehabilitate or make excuses for fascism. It should be viewed as an attempt to discredit and condemn democratism as a whole.

Democratism is explicitly based on "majority rule", which itself if based on the "right to rule", which isn't a right.

If there are any such things as rights, if they exist as an ethical primary, they must be individual rights, because any collective only has the intent to the extent and composed of the intents of it's individual members.

A "right to rule" would be a right to violate other's rights, which can't exist as a right without violating the principle of rights.

But that is what democratism intends to do. When the Founding Fathers were establishing the first nation in the world based in individual rights and politically creating a "new world", the people who founded the Democrat Party and modern democratism were already scheming on a way to smuggle in old-world "right to rule" ideology along the lines of the "divine right of kings" or the "mandate of heaven", both of which the Founding Fathers rejected.
