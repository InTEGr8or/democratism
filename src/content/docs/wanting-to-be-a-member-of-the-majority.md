The desire to be a member of the majority is a powerful psychological force that can lead individuals to conform to group norms and suppress their own opinions. This desire is often exploited by political leaders and demagogues who seek to manipulate public opinion and consolidate power.

The desire to be a member of the majority is particularly strong in democratic societies, where the will of the majority is often seen as the ultimate source of legitimacy. This can lead to a situation in which individuals are afraid to express dissenting opinions, for fear of being ostracized or marginalized.

They can become part of this majority party simply by believing what they are told the majority believes, and by promoting what they are told the majority promote and advocating what they are told the majority advocate for. Anyone can become part of the majority simply by voting for the candidate that the news clergy tells them will be the winner.

That's why the number one reported datum during election season is _who is in the lead_. And that is the datum that reaches a feave pitch the closer the day of election comes.
