Criminals are killing CEOs, and academic thought leaders are encouraging them. This is not a drill.

"Itâ€™s simple, you make them fear for their lives. #KillMoreCEOs" --Ethel Cain, after Brian Thompson was murdered.

Fundraiser for Luigi Mangione luigijustice.org lists healthcare spending as an item in his defense and raises of $200k.

HOST: What are you saying?

GUEST: I don't condone violence, but I hope I see something. There's got to be some point where somebody loses it and says, "I'm not happy with him trying to destroy democracy. I'm not happy with him trying to destroy the American dream."

You might think they'll only attack bigger companies, or they only want to kill bad CEOs, but you don't know what we know. CEOs are just the start.

The problem is so broad and pervasive that it must be attacked at its root.

We are working on a solution and we could use your help so we can help you and many people like you.
