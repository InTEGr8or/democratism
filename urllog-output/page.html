<p>Currently, the Democratic Party is in crisis, so it is a very good time to look closely at all the ways it is falling apart and ask ourselves: “Is this a failure of the Democratic Party, or are there problems with the concept of democracy as a political ideal?”</p>
<p>But why use the word “democratism” instead of “democracy”? Well, we have words such as liberalism and conservatism, which are used to describe political campaigns and ideologies. So, why not use the word “democratism” to describe the political campaign and ideology of democracy as a political campaign to promote the ideology of democracy? Anyone who doubts that this ideology is promoted needs only to look at the popular daily use of the word “democratization” in all its various meanings.</p>
<p>There should be no doubt that there is a political campaign to promote the ideology of democracy. There is even a recent compilation of hundreds of news promoters in hundreds of different markets in the US reciting the exact same multi-paragraph script which concludes with “this is extremely troublling to our democracy”. No reference is given to who wrote the script they are all reciting, but surely the multi-paragraph reciting was not repeated by hundreds of outlets accidently. Every standard of detecting plagerism would indicate that the public statement was <em>cooordinated</em>.</p>
<p>So, we are using “democratism” to describe the political campaign and ideology of democracy as a political campaign to promote the ideology of democracy. We will also loop in the concept of “democratization” as it is used in political <em>and economic</em> discourse and as an ideal.</p>
<p>To perform this comprehensive analysis, we must first clarify what the concept of democracy is. We’ll look at how democracy is used in political discourse and how it’s defined in political theory. Then, we’ll examine the core principles of democracy and critically evaluate them.</p>
<p>Why? Certainly, this is a worthy endeavor since so much of society and culture are handed over to democratic arbitration. The concept of “democratization” is widely used on a regular basis as an ideal to be used in determining who get’s what, and why. So, “democratization” will also fall under our microscope and telescope of critical analysis. We will attempt to look at it from every angle, including from the inside and the outside.</p>
<p>If democracy is prommoted as an idea, that is to say, as something to be pursued in life and even as a political campaign, and if it is false or flawed, then it will promote false requirements. False requirements <em>always</em> end up sovling the wrong problem. So we will also investigate all the cultural artifacts that have been produced and that we live with today because moralists and “thought leaders” have been promoting the false requirements of democracy for many decades.</p>
<p>So let us begin with a comprehensive list of both the popular concept of democracy and the more technically developed definitions of democracy so that we can “deconstruct” them.</p>
<p>NOTE: I will be using the justifications for democracy produced by OPEN AI’s GPT-4o model as a first draft. It has read much of the internet, and the LLM is specifically designed to produce the most common text phrases, so it is probably a better starting point than any academic study, however, we will also incorporate those as time permits.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the vast expanse of human history, the concept of democracy has been a beacon of hope and progress. However, the term “democracy” itself is often misunderstood, leading to misconceptions about its true essence and the values it upholds.</p>
<p>NOTE: Democracy “is often misunderstood” because the concept difers greatly from its implementation.</p>
<p>This article aims to clarify these misunderstandings and delve into the core principles of democracy, emphasizing the importance of “democratism” as a guiding force for a truly democratic society.</p>
<p>NOTE: This article will not assume that the dominant political theory is simply accidentally misunderstood. This article will ask the somewhat novel approach of asking if democracy as it is promoted and used is a coherent ideal. Certainly, a majority vote system exists and can be used, so we are not going to question if such a system can possibly be used. However, we will question the entire remainder of democracy wherin majority vote is promoted and campaigned for as the system to be applied generally.</p>
<h2 id="the-falacy-of-democratization">The Falacy of Democratization</h2>
<p>The only one good claim of Democracy is that it redistributes power.</p>
<p>Even that statement is too generous. The claimed intent of democracy is that it will redistribute power. That’s the sales pitch, and that would be a good thing for it to do. However, the redistribution of power is the farthest thing from what democracy delivers, or is even designed to do. Democratists will redistributed all goods and services that they have plundered from their citizens in order to avoid having to redistribute power.</p>
<h2 id="the-misunderstanding-of-democracy">The Misunderstanding of Democracy</h2>
<p>Democracy is often mistakenly equated with majority rule, where the will of the majority prevails over the rights and interests of minorities. This narrow interpretation fails to capture the essence of democracy, which is a system of governance that values individual rights, freedom, and equality.
Democracy is not merely about voting for leaders or making decisions through popular referendums. It is a complex system that encompasses various institutions, processes, and norms that ensure the participation, representation, and accountability of all citizens.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is quite a misdirection. Democracy <em>is rightfully</em> equated with majority rule, because that’s how it’s implemented. However, the misdirection gives away the game by telling us that democracy is actually made up of “a complex system that encompasses various institutions”, and the rest is mere “convincing language”. Democracy itself does not value individual rights, for instance, and democratists (promoters of democracy) often malign individual self interest as “selfishness”, and in opposition to “the common good”.</p>
<p>..So, the remaining part of the misdirection is the “complex system of institutions” part. This is a common misdirection, and it’s a way to make democracy sound more complex and sophisticated than it is. In reality, democracy is a simple system: the majority rules. That’s it. The “complex system of institutions” are the millions of governmet funded agencies, NGOs, and other organizations that are used to influence public opinion and promote the agenda of the majority elect. These institutions are not part of democracy itself. They are a way of for elected officials to move portions of their agenda beyond the accountablity of the electorate.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-principles-of-democracy">The Core Principles of Democracy</h2>
<p>To understand the true nature of democracy, let’s examine its core principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sovereignty of the People</strong>: The ultimate source of power in a democratic society is the people themselves. Citizens have the right to govern themselves and make decisions that reflect their collective will.</li>
<li><strong>Individual Rights and Freedoms</strong>: Democracy recognizes and protects the inherent rights and freedoms of every individual. These include the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as well as the right to equality before the law and the right to participate in the political process.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Powers</strong>: Democracy divides power among various institutions, such as the legislature, executive, and judiciary. This separation ensures that no single branch of government can exercise unchecked power and that checks and balances are in place to maintain the integrity of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Rule of Law</strong>: Democracy is based on the principle of the rule of law, which means that all citizens, including government officials, are subject to the same laws and are equal before the law. This ensures that the law is applied fairly and consistently.</li>
<li><strong>Representation and Accountability</strong>: Democracy requires that all citizens have the opportunity to be represented in the political process and that elected officials are held accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as regular elections, term limits, and the ability to recall or impeach officials.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="democratism-a-guiding-force-for-democracy">Democratism: A Guiding Force for Democracy</h2>
<p>Democratism is a philosophy that serves as a guiding force for democracy. It emphasizes the importance of active citizenship, participation, and engagement in the political process.
